Q1) What is cloud?

Ans-The cloud is made up of servers in data centers all over the world. Moving to the cloud can save companies money and add convenience for users.
The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers.
Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies don't have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.
The cloud enables users to access the same files and applications from almost any device, because the computing and storage takes place on servers in a data center, instead of locally on the user device.
This is why a user can log into their Instagram account on a new phone after their old phone breaks and still find their old account in place, with all their photos, videos, and conversation history.
It works the same way with cloud email providers like Gmail or Microsoft Office 365, and with cloud storage providers like Dropbox or Google Drive.
